## General Information
- This Project is a Notebook Assignment to understand and practice Convolutional Neural Network Models.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- We saw multiple ways to form a CNN Sequential model and fit it with original and transformed data
- Transformed Data helps in removing over/under fitting, but not in all cases.
- Using Google Collab helped us to evaluate/fit models very fast
